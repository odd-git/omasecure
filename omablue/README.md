# Omablue

Omablue aims to be the definitive "Omarchy-inspired" experience for secureblue. It is designed for users who demand a seamless, keyboard-driven tiling window manager environment on top of an ultra-secure, hardened Fedora Atomic base.

## The Vision

This project bridges the gap between high-level security and modern aesthetics. As a Project Manager with a passion for Open Source, Privacy, and Security, I have initiated this mockup/MVP to demonstrate how a hardened system can be both beautiful and highly functional.

The goal is to provide a "state of the art" Sway configuration that respects the immutable nature of the host system while offering a fluid, keyboard-centric workflow.

## Core Principles

Security-First: Built for the secureblue ecosystem.

Atomic-Friendly: Prioritizes Flatpak, Homebrew, and ujust over host-level layering.

Keyboard Dominance: Optimized for Sway/Wayland with minimal mouse interaction.

Minimalist Aesthetics: Clean, functional UI with integrated notification handling via Dunst.

## 🛠 Features & Roadmap

## Getting Started

Prerequisites

A working installation of Secureblue Sericea.

Installation

Clone the repository:

### 1. Clone Omablue

```bash
git clone https://github.com/odd-git/omablue ~/omablue
cd ~/omablue
```

### 2. Run Setup

```bash
just setup-omablue
```

### Extra

if you want to set a different sddm background:

run0 mkdir -p /var/lib/sddm/themes
run0 cp -r /usr/share/sddm/themes/* /var/lib/sddm/themes/
rename the copied folder in from something like "fedora-sway"" in "secureblue"
edit theme.conf by choosing the background you like to see for eg.
background=/usr/share/backgrounds/secureblue/secureblue-blue.png

edit or create /etc/sddm.conf.d/theme-path.conf by adding the following lines

[Theme]
ThemeDir=/var/lib/sddm/themes
Current=secureblue

## Contributing & Credits

This project is inspired by omarchy and many of the utility are based on the omarchy or at least ispired by them.

A significant portion of the logic in these scripts was inspired by or adapted from community efforts (including vibecoding and AI-assisted drafts).

Note on Security: I am aware that the secureblue maintainers prioritize human-audited code. This project serves as a functional mockup; I invite developers to audit, refactor, and improve these scripts to reach the highest standards of the secureblue project.

If you find a bug or have a feature request, please open an issue.
